# ASM_minilibc_2018

This project was the only assembly project from my second year at EPITECH (2017-2018)

The goal was to create a dynamic ELF library to replace some of the standard C library functions.


Language: x86-64 assembly

Group size: 1

Project duration: ~1 month

Compilation: on GNU/Linux via Makefile

Assembly files are compiled with the [nasm assembler](https://www.nasm.us/).
